ramses with you

    - 1 - The tool is a simple physics calculator 
          to help with some common laws of physics equations

    - 2 - The language of the tool that I chose is Arabic, for special reasons

    - 3 - The password idea you can consider as a simple gift for beginners
          and it is not for protection at all due to the ease of expectation 
          and the presence of its file inside the tool folder

    - 4 - The tool is still in an experimental stage and has not been completed yet
          and I hope that the existing part of it will be sufficient to express the idea of ​​the tool

    - 5 - Between light and darkness there is life
